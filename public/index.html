      <p>Title of Research Study: Mobile Implicit Behavior Based Authentication
      </p>
      <p>Introduction You are being asked to participate in a research study.  Before you agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your participation.  This form presents information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your participation. 
      </p>
      <p>Purpose of the study: Collecting data to test a system by which people can be authenticated to mobile devices via their behavior rather than passwords.
      </p>
      <p>Procedures to be followed:  In order to participate in this study, you must have an Android mobile phone. You must install the provided mobile application on your device using the instructions below via this link: 
      </p>
      <p>Risks to study participants: There are no risks that you may encounter as part of this study, other than that your data will be aggregated for research purposes.
      </p>
      <p>Benefits to research participants and others:  This research will not immediately benefit you. However, the eventual goal of this research is to develop a system that will make mobile devices both more secure and convenient to use.
      </p>
      <p>Record keeping and confidentiality:  Records of your participation in this study will be held confidential so far as permitted by law.  However, the study investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to confidential data that identify you by name.  Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify you. Your data will be encrypted and held only on a secure WPI research server.
      </p>
      <p>Cost/Payment: For SONA, the students will get course credit for participating in your study. For other participants, their names will entered into a raffle for a $50 gift card. 
      </p>
      <p>For more information about this research or about the rights of research participants, or in case of research-related injury, contact: Bryan J. Benson (Tel. 195-564-1124, Email: bjbenson@wpi.edu), Benjamin Huchley (Tel. 4087170050, Email: bhuchley@wpi.edu), Derrek Rueger (Tel. 4138543920, Email: drueger@wpi.edu), Emmanuel Agu (Tel. 508.831.5568, Email: emmanuel@cs.wpi.edu), IRB Chair (Professor Kent Rissmiller, Tel. 508-831-5019, Email:  kjr@wpi.edu) and the University Compliance Officer (Jon Bartelson, Tel. 508-831-5725, Email:  jonb@wpi.edu).
      </p>
      <p>Your participation in this research is voluntary.  Your refusal to participate will not result in any penalty to you or any loss of benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled.  You may decide to stop participating in the research at any time without penalty or loss of other benefits.  The project investigators retain the right to cancel or postpone the experimental procedures at any time they see fit.  
      </p>

      <h2>Additional clauses to add to Consent Agreements, as appropriate:</h2>

      <p>The treatment or procedures used in this research may involve risks to the subject (or to an embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant), which are currently unknown or unforeseeable.  
      </p>

      <p>Significant new findings or information, developed during the course of the research, may alter the subject’s willingness to participate in the study.  Any such findings will be promptly communicated to all research participants.
      </p>


      <p>Special Exceptions:  Under certain circumstances, an IRB may approve a consent procedure which differs from some of the elements of informed consent set forth above.  Before doing so, however, the IRB must make findings regarding the research justification for different procedures (i.e. a waiver of some of the informed consent requirements must be necessary for the research is to be “practicably carried out.”)  The IRB must also find that the research involves “no more than minimal risk to the subjects.”  Other requirements are found at 45 C.F.R. §46.116.</p>
